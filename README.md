## How i did it
First at all i had to center de container "main",styled the body to made it; after this i split the container in two parts, one with the card options and another in wich i put the other div-container,I manipulated all the changes with javascript; i used querySelector to 
select and inner the elements; the logic to change form monthly to yearly was made it with 
javascript too.
In the mobile design i just changed some displays and units using media-query.
